# Samplify
"Your sample library made simple."

Samplify is multi-platform compatable software tool aimed to help content creators organize their media libraries in a simple & fully customizable fashion. Users can choose to process media assets to an output library of their choosing through use of a highly customizable XML template. Samplify is written in Python and has quite a few package dependencies. More information on setup and installation of these will be coming soon.

Samplify is optimized for real-time conversion of your libraries so that your output media is automatically updated as your input libraries are expanded or modified using the Watchdog API.

Samplify support multi-threaded processing and uses various frameworks for media conversion such as FFmpeg and Pill. Because of this, it has a wide veriety of file support and encoding/decoding options.

**Some features include:**

-Real-time input file detection.

-Independant customization options for output directory trees.

-Multi-processing support.

-GPU-Acceleration (If codec available).

-Regular Expression pattern-finding support for filenames/types.

-Wide file support through FFMpeg and other frameworks.

-End-User graphical interface (Coming soon).

**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS**

Development is currently being performed in a windows enviroment. Although project dependencies are supported on other operating systems, I have not yet tested any code on them.
